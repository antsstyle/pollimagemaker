<h2>About PollImageMaker</h2>
PollImageMaker is a Java application for cropping and concatenating images, for Patreon polls or similar purposes. It allows you to put many images together, either as sets of two or as one image, adding numbers and text to show what each of your poll options are.

Here's an example of a finished image: https://i.imgur.com/9SsWYCK.png

<h2>How to use PollImageMaker</h2>

If you're an artist and want to use this, download the PollImageMaker-1.2.jar above and run it. You will need to have the Java Runtime Environment installed if you don't already, you can find that here: https://www.java.com/en/download/.

You can drag and drop images into the main window, at which the application will prompt you to crop the image if necessary. That window looks like this: (with whatever image you dragged in)

The "dual-width image" option, if selected, causes the image to become one poll option on its own, which will span the entire width of the overall image as opposed to being one half of an option.

<h2>Trouble?</h2>
